# Heart-prediction
It is my first web application made by **Flask** a python web framework.\
The web app helps to predict the possibility of getting heart attack based upon current health stats.

## Working
- Get your current health stats
- The web application asks following information
    - Do you have anaemia ?
    - What is your gender ?
    - What is your platelets count ?
    - What is your age ?
    - Do you have diabetes ?
    - Are you high blood pressure patient ?
    - Do you smoke ?
        
Based upon your answers to those questions, the machine learning model trained on the dataset found on Kaggle, it predicts the health status.\
The model has class imbalance problem [**issue**]

## Installation
1. Install the requirements. `pip install < requirements.txt`
2. Run command `python app.py`
Flask will start the local server and you can test the website.
